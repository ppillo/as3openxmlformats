AS3 and MS Office? That may sound werid party, that is why I did not find the existing project to solve the problem.

This is a project based on ActionScript 3 to parse and format MS Office Open XML Formats, for Word 2007, Excel 2007 and PowerPoint 2007 files.

The as3 lib called 'deng' is used for zip operation. Therefore, the project can only be EFFECTIVE in AIR program, not Flex for Web, since the compress methods are used - which is only allowed in AIR.
